                <h2>What is Star Wars?</h2>
                <p>No, it is not a war of stars. The Star Wars franchise is set in a fictional galaxy far, far away and follows the adventures of various characters, including Jedi Knights, Sith Lords, smugglers, and droids, as they struggle for control of the galaxy and fight against the forces of evil.</p>
                <h2>So what exactly is the content in Star Wars?</h2>
                <p>There is a lot of content in the Star Wars universe. Theres tv shows, films, comics, video games, and more. The movies started off with the Original Trilogy (Episodes IV-VI) and then they began to branch off from there. Creating more movies, tv shows, and readings about what was in between. Still to this day, the story of Star Wars continues and I am not sure if we ever see an end. </p>
                <h2>An Important Note</h2>
                <p>Not every piece of media you see about Star Wars is considered canon. Star Wars Legends, formerly known as the Expanded Universe (EU), refers to the vast collection of stories, characters, and settings that were created outside of the main Star Wars films and television shows. In 2014, with the acquisition of Lucasfilm by Disney, the Star Wars Legends continuity was rebranded as non-canon, meaning that these stories are no longer considered part of the official Star Wars continuity. However, many fans still enjoy the Legends stories and consider them an important part of the Star Wars universe. </p>
                <h2>Star Wars Media:</h2>
                <h3>Movies:</h3>
                <p id="movies" style="color: #ffffff;"></p>
                <h3>TV Shows:</h3>
                <p id="shows" style="color: #ffffff;"></p>
                <h3>Books & Comics: </h3>
                <p id="books" style="color: #ffffff;"></p>
                <h3>Video Games:</h3>
                <p id="games" style="color: #ffffff;"></p>
                <h2>Is it too late to start?</h2>
                <p>Absolutely not! If you really want to get an overall view, then just watch the movies. They will provide you enough information to get you caught up. Going more in depth is watching the shows, although this will take you a bit longer. At this point is where I would be considered all caught up. For the books, comics, and video games. They do add more to the story, but are not neccessary to get a good overview of the story. If you want to go deep, then by all means do so. </p>
